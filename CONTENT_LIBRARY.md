## 2026 Social Media Intelligence

### CRITICAL: Instagram now limits to 5 hashtags per post
All content templates use 5-tag groups. Keywords in captions and alt text now drive discovery more than hashtags.

### Platform Strategy
- **Instagram:** 5 posts/week, carousels dominate (85%+), text overlay trending, hashtags in first comment
- **Bluesky:** Easiest to connect. Growing bourbon community. More hashtags OK.
- **Twitter/X:** Fast engagement, industry conversations
- **Facebook:** Longer-form, older bourbon audience
- **LinkedIn:** Marianne's entrepreneurship story
